## Sportsbook Review Fields

Besides adding your review title and content as usual, you'll find **Sportsbook Review Fields** section below page content. Here you can define properties for each review. The fields are in separate sections and have descriptions to make it easy for you to fill them in. To see what they look like you can check one of the demos available [here](https://dinomatic.com/demos/kemoku).
