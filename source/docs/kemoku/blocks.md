# Kemoku Plugin Blocks

There are multiple blocks and shortcodes available for you to present your website information. It is recommended to use native blocks instead of shortcodes, however if for some reason you're still using a version of WordPress lower than 5.0, you can use shortcodes as well.

There are 2 groups of blocks:

1. blocks you can use on all pages
2. blocks you can use on review pages

## Using Blocks

Below are the blocks available in Kemoku plugin you can use on all pages:

- Reviews Table
- Reviews Grid
- Review CTA

### Reviews Table & Grid

Simply add the block, select reviews you want to display, adjust the settings and they are ready.

`💁 since version 1.5` you can choose reviews manually, filter them by category or by tag(s).

You can select a review category and all reviews in that category will be displayed. You can also set a limit, for example display 10 reviews in "Sports" category.

Besides categories, you can filter reviews by review tags as well. In difference to categories, you can select multiple tags. For example, display 12 reviews tagged "USA" and "Canada". You can combine those 2 together, for example display 10 reviews in "Sports" category tagged "USA" and "Canada".

`💁 since version 1.5.7` you can overwrite bonus and affiliate link values on each table/grid block.
