# Using Nonaki Plugin

Using Nonaki plugin is easy and intuitive. You can access all plugin options and links/redirects in plugin settings page.

## Plugin Settings Page

Plugin settings can be found in `Nonaki Options` page visiting `Nonaki Links` in your WordPress dashboard.

### Setting the Redirect Slug

The only thing to do before using the plugin is to set up a **redirect slug** for your affiliate links, which you can skip if the default `links` value is good for you. If not, just type whatever you need and simply click `Save`.
