# Demo Import

One Click Demo Import for Akurai theme.

## How to import demo content

Instead of starting from scratch, with Akurai you have options to import demo content and make your adjustments.

### One Click Demo Import

With **One Click Demo Import** option you can import demo content, as well as customizations and widgets exactly the way they are on demo websites.

You need to install [One Click Demo Import](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/) plugin from WP plugin directory. Once it's installed and activated, there will be a new submenu item in your WP dashboard &#8594; Appearance called "**Akurai Demo Import**".

Visit that page, select the demo website and import it. You can also install optional plugins the during import process. Once the import is completed your website will like the demo you selected.

If for some reason you get an error when trying to import the demo, try switching to manual method and upload the below files:

- Athens demo - [content](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/contents/athens.xml), [customizer](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/customizer/athens.dat), [widgets](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/widgets/athens.wie)
- Berlin demo - [content](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/contents/berin.xml), [customizer](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/customizer/berin.dat), [widgets](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/widgets/berin.wie)
- Lisbon demo - [content](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/contents/lisbon.xml), [customizer](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/customizer/lisbon.dat), [widgets](https://demos.dinomatic.com/data/widgets/lisbon.wie)

### Manual Content Import

If you prefer to customize the theme on your own, you can download a `.xml` file from your DinoMatic account that contains the demo content. After that you can import it to your new website using WP Importer following [simple steps](https://wordpress.org/support/article/importing-content/#wordpress). It will not import the customizations or widgets to your website.
