# Akurai Widgets

Akurai theme comes with built-in review widgets that you can use in page sidebars.

---

### Blocks as Widget

Since WordPress 5.8 update, blocks can be used as widgets. The theme is updated so that you can use blocks in widget areas.

There's a new blocks category called **Akurai Widgets** that lets you add the same 2 block widgets: Single Review and Reviews List.

You can also use all review page blocks in review page sidebar.

> It is recommended to use blocks instead of legacy widgets, as they may not get updated in the future.
