- Banking
- Offers
- Bonus List

The 5 blocks, except Bonus List, require no configuration, all you need is to just add them to the content by clicking on the block name. The information is populated from [Review Fields](/docs/akurai/creating-review-pages/) that you need to have filled in beforehand.

For Bonus List block you need to specify bonuses and their names, as well as optional heading and button texts.


### Shortcodes

The same blocks are also available to use in [Review Page Sidebars](/docs/akurai/widget-areas/) via shortcodes. Hereâ€™s the formats:

- `[info]`
- `[pros_cons]`
- `[ratings]`
- `[banking]`
- `[offers]`
- `[bonus_list]`

For `[bonus_list]` shortcode here's how too specify bonuses:
```
[bonus_list bonus_1="1st BONUS" bonus_2="2nd BONUS" bonus_3="" bonus_4="" bonus_5=""]
```
