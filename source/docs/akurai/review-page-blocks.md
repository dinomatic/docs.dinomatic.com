- Ratings
- Banking
- Offers

All the 5 blocks require no configuration, all you need is to just add them to the content by clicking on the block name. The information is populated from [Review Fields](/docs/akurai/creating-review-pages) that you need to have filled in beforehand.

### Shortcodes

The same blocks are also available to use in [Review Page Sidebars](/docs/akurai/widget-areas) via shortcodes. Hereâ€™s the formats:

- `[info]`
- `[offer]`
- `[pros_cons]`
- `[banking]`
- `[ratings]`

### Blocks in Content Area
