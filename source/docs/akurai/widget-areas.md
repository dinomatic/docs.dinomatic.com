### Main Sidebar

**Main Sidebar** is displayed on pages with the default page template.

### Left Sidebar

**Left Sidebar** is displayed on pages with the **Left Sidebar** page template.
Here you can add different [widgets](/docs/akurai/widgets/) if you want to.

### Review Page Sidebar

**Review Page Sidebar** is displayed on review pages where you can add review page blocks via shortcodes.

For example, the **Sportsbook Info** shortcode, all you need to do is add the shortcode to the widget body and add an optional widget title. You can use other [review page shortcodes](/docs/akurai/review-page-blocks/) the same way.

### Footer Widgets

The theme footer is divided into 4 equal parts each one of them displaying a single widget area.
This way you can have long footer without having to worry about their responsive structure.

You can use both default WordPress widgets as well as Akurai Sportsbook widgets in your footer. Here's an example footer widget area.
