## Review Page Hero

All review pages have a hero section at the top to display information about the sportsbook such as the logo, ratings, bonus, etc.

### Hero Styles

You can customize the hero to display in 1 or 2 columns. Also you can choose to display the page heading (`h1` tag) below or above the hero. You can make this changes in [Customizer &#8594; Review Options](/docs/akurai/customizations/#review-options).
