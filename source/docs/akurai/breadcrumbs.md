### Breadcrumbs Options

**Reviews page Parent page**

Akurai doesn't enforce users to have a parent page for review pages, however you can set one in breadcrumbs.

**Blog posts**

By default breadcrumbs for posts pages includes categories, however you can add blog page as well. Just make sure to check the box _Include blog page in posts breadcrumbs_.

### Schema.org markup

Akurai also includes structured data (schema.org) markup for [breadcrumbs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/breadcrumb) out of the box, so you don't need to do anything.

> **Do not enable breadcrumbs option in Yoast, as you'll end up having duplicate markup.**
