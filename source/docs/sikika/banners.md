There are 2 main positions available for banners in Sikika: **Top** and **Bottom**.

Moreover, you can choose to display banners:

1. before main content area or before page content
2. after main content area or after page content

**Main content area** is the area next to sidebar.
**Page content area** is the main content area + the sidebar.

You can also decide whether to display the banners or not on different **post types** (posts or pages) and on the homepage.
