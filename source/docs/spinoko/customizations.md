### Site Identity

As usual, set your site title and tagline, upload a custom logo and a favicon. If you have a really wide logo, you can hide the site title from header for better appearance.

### Colors

Spinoko has a lot of colors, there are **21 carefully selected colors** that are used all over the theme. You can adjust them to your liking and use your own color pallettes or the one that comes by default.

### Menus

Spinoko has 2 navigation menu locations - **Header** and **Footer**. Create menus and assign locations here.

### Widgets

Spinoko has no sidebars, the only widget area is in footer - Footer Widgets. You can add widgets to footer and they'll be displayed in a 3 column grid section. Or you can leave the widget area empty.

### Homepage Settings

 You can choose whatâ€™s displayed on the homepage of your site. It can be posts/blog page, or a static page. To set a static homepage, you first need to create two Pages. One will become the homepage, and the other will be where your posts are displayed.

### Additional CSS

If you need to make minor changes to the theme (or plugins) styles, you can do so in **Additional CSS** section.

### Additional Scripts

If you need to embed some scripts to your page, you can do it in **Additional Scripts** section. Here you have 2 locations:

- Header scripts - that will go into the head of the page
- Footer scripts - that will go into the footer part
