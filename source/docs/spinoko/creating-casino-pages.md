# Creating Casino Pages

In your WordPress dashboard you will find a new menu item called **Casinos** right below the **Pages** menu link. Click `Add New` to add a new casino.

### Casino Page Templates

This page describes casino specific fields, for casino page templates, please follow this [link](/docs/spinoko/casino-page-templates/).

### Casino Fields

Besides adding the casino title and content as usual, youâ€™ll find Casino Fields section below the page content. Here you can define properties for each casino. The fields are in separate sections and have descriptions to make it easy for you to fill them in. These properties are used all over the website, please make sure to fill them in.

### Casino Page Blocks

To present the information more visually you can use [casino blocks](/docs/spinoko/casino-page-blocks/) in casino page contents, as well as [generic blocks](/docs/spinoko/blocks/) such as FAQs, Recent posts, etc.

### Casino Page Top Tables

By default on all casino pages, after the hero section appear 3 small tables: Info, Pros & Cons. These are generated from Casino Fields as well and you can disable them globally for your website in **Appearance** &#8594; **Customize** &#8594; **Review Options**
