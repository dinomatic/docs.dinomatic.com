## Product Key

You can get your product key from your [DinoMatic account](https://dinomatic.com/account)

### Add Product Key

1. In WordPress dashboard visit **Settings** &#8594; **Theme Setup** &#8594; **Licence Key**
2. Enter the key you got from your account
3. Click `Submit`
4. A message confirming the theme registration will appear

If you get an error that the license key is not correct and the registration fails:

- make sure there are no white spaces in the beginning or at the end of the key
- if you have firewall installed on your server, make sure requests to dinomatic.com are not being blocked
