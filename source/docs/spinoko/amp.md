# AMP Support

Spinoko comes with built-in AMP support.

---

Spinoko supports AMP functionality out of the box. All you have to do is just install the **official AMP plugin for WordPress** and activate it.

Here's the AMP Plugin settings page:

You can get the plugin from WordPress Plugins Directory: [AMP By AMP Project Contributors](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) or add it through your WordPress dashboard Plugins page.

To check the AMP functionality of the theme, simply append ?amp to the page URLs.
