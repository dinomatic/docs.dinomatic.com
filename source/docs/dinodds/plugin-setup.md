# Plugin Setup

You need to set up the plugin to be able to use it.

## Client ID

Your DinOdds Client ID is the license key you get when purchasing a subscription. You can get it from your [DinoMatic account](https://dinomatic.com/account).

### Add Client ID

After activating DinOdds plugin, you'll find a new menu item in your WordPress dashboard left hand navigation: **DinOdds**. Visit that page by clicking the menu item or **Settings** link in your plugins listing.

You'll be prompted to add your Client ID, enter it and click the **Save** button.
