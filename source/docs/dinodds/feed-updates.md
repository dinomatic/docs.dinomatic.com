# Feed Updates

Feeds are updated automatically every hour. Read more about scheduling [here](/docs/dinodds/scheduling/)

### Manually Update Feeds

Generally, feeds update every hour, so in most cases there's no need to update them manually. However, if you need to, you can do so just by clicking the **Update Feeds** button. Feeds will be updated and you'll see a message confirming it with the number of matches updated for each league.
