2. Left Sidebar
3. Review Page Sidebar
4. Footer Widgets #1
5. Footer Widgets #2
6. Footer Widgets #3
7. Footer Widgets #4

### Main Sidebar

**Main Sidebar** is displayed on pages with the **Right Sidebar** page template.

### Left Sidebar

**Left Sidebar** is displayed on pages with the **Left Sidebar** page template.

### Review Page Sidebar

**Review Page Sidebar** is displayed on review pages with **Review with Sidebar** template where you can add review page blocks (also via shortcodes).

### Footer Widgets

The theme footer is divided into 4 equal parts, each one of them displaying a single widget area.
This way you can have a long footer without having to worry about their responsive structure.
