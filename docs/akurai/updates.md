# Akurai Theme Updates

Akurai updates are baked into the theme, meaning you will receive them in your WordPress dashboard as soon as they are available and you don't have to do anything more than just clicking the update button, no need to download the theme and upload through FTP again.

However, if for some reason you want to do that, you still can just download the theme files from your account, remove the old theme directory and upload the new one to your server.
