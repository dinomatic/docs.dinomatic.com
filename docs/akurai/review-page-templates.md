## Using Review Page Templates

There are 3 page templates available for displaying **Review Pages** in your website.

1. Default Template
2. Review with Sidebar
3. Banner Template

### Default Template

The default template layout has 100% wide content area, no sidebars, no widgets.
You can display a [hero section](#review-page-hero) on top reviews with default template.

### Review with Sidebar

This is just like the default template, however it has a sidebar on the right, where you can add review page and general widgets.
You can display a [hero section](#review-page-hero) on top reviews with default template.

### Banner Template

Review pages with the banner template have a nice section on top of the page to display important review information such as the logo, bonus, country support, payment methods, etc. You can change its background color for each review to make them unique.

### Review Page Hero

Default review pages have a hero section at the top to display information about the sportsbook such as the logo, ratings, bonus, etc. You can customize the hero to display in 1 or 2 columns. Also you can choose to display the page heading (`h1` tag) below or above the hero. You can make this changes in [Customizer &#8594; Review Options](/docs/akurai/customizations/#review-options).
