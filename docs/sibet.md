## Getting Started

It's easy to get started with Sibet. Follow the documentations to install and start using the plugin.

### Requirements

Before getting started make sure you have all the requirements met.

To use the plugin, you must be running `WordPress 5.0` or higher and `PHP 7.4` or higher. Recommended `WordPress 6.6`.

Also make sure your host has the minimum requirements to run WordPress and PHP `max_upload_size` is more than 2MB.

### API Subscription

To use the plugin you need to have a monthly or yearly subscription and need to adjust your subscription settings.

You can control the API settings in your DinoMatic account. Click on Subscriptions tab, locate the subscription you're looking for and click on "Plugin Settings" link. On the settings page simply choose the leagues, the bookmakers and the markets you're interested in, fill in your website's domain name and IP address and submit the form.

### Scheduling

To be able to display the latest odds feeds, your website needs to pull the data from Sibet API periodically and for this you may have to set up system cron jobs. Read more [here](/docs/dinodds/scheduling/).
