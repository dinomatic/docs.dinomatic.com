# Affiliate Links

SpinokoGeo plugin allows you to set country-specific affiliate links for each casino review. This means you can have different affiliate links for different countries, making your affiliate marketing more targeted and effective.

## Overview

The Geo Affiliate Links feature enables you to:

- Set different affiliate links for different countries
- Use a default affiliate link as fallback
- Manage all country-specific links in one place
- Automatically serve the correct link based on visitor's location

### Setting Up Geo Affiliate Links

To set up country-specific affiliate links for a casino review:

- Edit the casino review post
- Look for the "üåç Geo Affiliate Links" tab in the editor
- Enter the affiliate link for each country you want to target
- Leave any country's field empty to use the default affiliate link instead

### How It Works

The plugin automatically detects the visitor's country using Cloudflare's IP Geolocation service and serves the appropriate affiliate link. If no country-specific link is set, it falls back to the default affiliate link.
