# AMP Support

Akurai comes with built-in AMP support.

`üíÅ since version 2.0`

---

Akurai supports AMP functionality out of the box. All you have to do is just install the **official AMP plugin for WordPress**, activate it and follow the wizard to set it up. It's quite straightforward.

You can get the plugin from WordPress Plugins Directory: [AMP By AMP Project Contributors](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) or add it through your WordPress dashboard Plugins page.

To check the AMP functionality of the theme, simply append `?amp` at the page URLs.
