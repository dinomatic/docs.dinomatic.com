## Using Page Templates

There are 6 page templates available for displaying **Pages** in your website.

1. Default Template
2. Left Sidebar Template
3. Right Sidebar Template
4. Hero Template
5. Hero Full Screen Template
6. Banner Template

### Default Template

**Default** template layout has only content area covering its 100% width. There's no sidebar used.

Check out an example of a default template [here](https://demos.dinomatic.com/atlanta/page-templates/default-template/).

### Left Sidebar Template

**Left Sidebar** template layout has the content area on the right and the sidebar on the left.
The sidebar used in Left Sidebar templates is called **Left Sidebar**.

Check out an example of a left sidebar template [here](https://demos.dinomatic.com/atlanta/page-templates/page-with-left-sidebar/).

### Right Sidebar Template

**Right Sidebar Template** template layout has the content area on the left and the sidebar on the right. The sidebar used in default templates is called **Main Sidebar**.

Check out an example of a right sidebar template [here](https://demos.dinomatic.com/atlanta/page-templates/page-with-right-sidebar/).

### Page with Top Listing

For general templates (Default, Left and Right Sidebar) you can add a top listing at the top of the pages. The listing has the main table design of the theme and occupies a full content width regardless whether there's a sidebar or not.

### Hero Template

**Hero** template uses the same layout as the default template, however it adds nice hero section on top of the page.

In each hero template there are 3 areas: top and main. The top area can have a heading, some text content, as well as a link/button. Top area is optional.

The main area can be either "3 Reviews Block" or "2 Columns Block". If you choose the "3 Reviews Block", you need to select reviews and they will be displayed in a grid layout.

If you choose the "2 Columns Block", you'll have 2 blocks (left and right) to fill in with information. Each one of them can have either a review, a text content, a collection of links/buttons or an image. Each section can also have an optional heading.

With all these options you can have very many different page layouts, and obviously you can adjust the hero styles, e.g. background image, colors, sizes, spacing, etc.

### Hero Full Screen Template

**Hero Full Screen** template uses the same layout as the default template, however it adds nice hero section on top of the page that covers the whole screen.

Each full screen hero template consists of 2 sections: top and bottom. Top section can have a heading and some text content, as well as a link/button. Only text content is required.

The bottom section can be either "4 Columns of Review Boxes" or "4 Columns of Custom Content". For review boxes you just select 4 reviews and they will be displayed nicely in a grid layout. For custom content, for each box you can add an image, a heading, text content and a URL, heading and URL fields are optional.

You can adjust the hero styles, e.g. background image, colors, sizes, spacing, etc.

### Banner Template

**Banner Template** again uses the default page layout and adds a nice banner-like section on top. The section is divided into 3 areas: left, right and bottom.

The left area has an image background with a heading, text content and a link/button, the right area is a collection of reviews and the bottom area is some text content.
You can adjust the styles for the whole section choosing all its colors and sizes.
