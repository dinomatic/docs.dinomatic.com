# AMP Support

Sikika comes with built-in AMP support.

---

Sikika supports AMP functionality out of the box. All you have to do is just install the official AMP plugin for WordPress and activate it. And that's all, you don't need to do anything else.

You can get the plugin from WordPress Plugins Directory: [AMP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) or add it through your WordPress dashboard Plugins page.

To check the AMP functionality of the theme, simply append ?amp to the page URLs.
