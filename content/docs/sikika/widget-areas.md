### Default Widget Areas

There are 2 widget areas available for you in Sikika by default:

- **Main Sidebar**: The primary sidebar that appears on the right side of your content
- **Footer Widgets**: Widget area in the footer section of your website

### Review Page Sidebar

If you're using [Kemoku Sportsbook Reviews Plugin](https://dinomatic.com/plugins/kemoku), you'll get another sidebar for Kemoku review pages where you can define general widgets as well as use Kemoku review shortcodes.
