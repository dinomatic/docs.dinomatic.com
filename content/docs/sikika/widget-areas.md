# Widget Areas

There are multiple widget areas built-in into Sikika theme.

---

### Default Widget Areas

There are 3 widget areas available for you in Sikika by default:

- **Main Sidebar** (default)
- **Left Sidebar**
- **Footer Widgets**

### Review Page Sidebar

If you're using [Kemoku Sportsbook Reviews Plugin](https://dinomatic.com/plugins/kemoku), you'll get another sidebar for Kemoku review pages where you can define general widgets as well as use Kemoku review shortcodes.
