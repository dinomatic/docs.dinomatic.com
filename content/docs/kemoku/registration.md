# Plugin Registration

You need to register your plugin to be able to receive new security and feature updates.

## Setup Page

After activating the plugin you'll be prompted with a notice to add your product key and configure your review pages.

Click on **the setup page** link to access the plugin setup interface.

## Plugin Registration

The setup page includes three main sections. The first section is for plugin registration.

### Add Product Key

1. **Get Your Product Key**: You can find your product key in your [DinoMatic account dashboard](https://dinomatic.com/account)
2. **Enter Product Key**: On the setup page, enter the product key you got from your DinoMatic account
3. **Save**: Click "Save" to register the plugin
4. **Confirmation**: A message confirming the plugin product key registration will appear

### Troubleshooting Registration

If you get an error that the license key is not correct and the registration fails:

- Make sure there are no white spaces at the beginning or end of the key
- If you have a firewall installed on your server, make sure requests to dinomatic.com are not being blocked
