## Review Fields

Besides adding your review title and content as usual, you'll find **Review Fields** section below page content. Here you can define properties for each review. The fields are in separate sections and have descriptions to make it easy for you to fill them in. To see what they look like you can check one of the demos available [here](https://demos.dinomatic.com/havana).

### General Fields

### Schema.org markup

For all your review pages the plugin generates **Review Snippet Structured Data** (schema.org) markup. The rating value used is the "Rating" field from "Bonus & Rating" section. It is generated automatically so you don't need to do anything. You can test your pages [here](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool).

By default the review snippet author is set as "Organization" and the name is your website title.

`üíÅ since version 1.5.2` you can change the author to "Person" and that would be the review page author. You can do that in Kemoku Settings &#8594; [General](/docs/kemoku/settings#general-settings).

### Taxonomies

`üíÅ since version 1.5` you can assign **Categories** and **Tags** to review pages,
and you can filter reviews on tables and grids by category and tag as well.
