# Geo-Targeting

`üíÅ since version 2.0`

Kemoku includes powerful geo-targeting features that automatically adapt your review content based on your visitors' location. This ensures visitors see relevant operators and get the right affiliate links for their country.

---

## How Geo-Targeting Works

When a visitor lands on your review page, Kemoku automatically detects their country and shows personalized content:

- **Country Support Messages**: Clear indicators showing if the operator accepts players from the visitor's country
- **Smart Affiliate Links**: Automatic routing to the correct affiliate link for the visitor's location
- **Filtered Listings**: Option to hide reviews for operators that don't accept the visitor's country
- **Fallback Pages**: Redirect visitors from unsupported countries to relevant alternatives

---

## Country Detection

Kemoku uses multiple methods to detect visitor locations, with automatic fallbacks for maximum accuracy:

### Cloudflare Integration

If you're using Cloudflare, Kemoku automatically detects visitor countries through Cloudflare's geo headers. This is the fastest and most accurate method.

**No setup required** - it works automatically when Cloudflare is active.

### MaxMind GeoLite2

For sites not using Cloudflare, you can add your free MaxMind license key for professional-grade geo-location.

1. Get a free license key from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)
2. Go to **Kemoku Reviews** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Geo Targeting**
3. Enter your MaxMind license key
4. The plugin will automatically download and update the geo database

### Intelligent Fallbacks

If neither Cloudflare nor MaxMind is available, Kemoku uses a default country (US) that you can customize through the `kemoku_geo_default_country_code` filter:

```php
<?php

add_filter( 'kemoku_geo_default_country_code', function( $default ) {
    return 'gb'; // Return country code
} );
```

## Geo-Targeting Settings

Configure geo-targeting options in **Kemoku Reviews** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Geo Targeting**.

### Country Support Messages

Customize the messages visitors see based on their country support status:

- **Supported Text**: Message when the operator accepts players from the visitor's country (default: `%review% supports players from %country%`)
- **Unsupported Text**: Message when the operator doesn't accept players from the visitor's country (default: `%review% does not support players from %country%`)
- **Bonus Text**: Bonus information shown for supported countries (default: `%bonus%`)
- **Affiliate Link/Button Text**: Text for the affiliate button (default: `Claim Now`)
- **Not Supported Additional Text**: Alternative message for unsupported countries (default: `Check out our other reviews for %country% %link%`)

### Fallback Configuration

Set up fallback pages for visitors from unsupported countries:

- **Page link URL**: Where to redirect visitors when an operator doesn't accept their country
- **Page link text**: Customize the link text (default: your site name)

### MaxMind License Key

Enter your MaxMind license key for geo-location when Cloudflare headers are not available.
