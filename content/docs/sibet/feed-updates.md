# Feed Updates

Feeds are updated automatically every hour. Read more about scheduling [here](/docs/dinodds/scheduling/)

### Manually Update Feeds

Generally, feeds are updated every hour, so in most cases there's no need to update them manually. However, if you need to, you can do so just visiting the **Updates** tab and clicking the **Update Feeds** button. Feeds will be updated and you'll see a message confirming it.
