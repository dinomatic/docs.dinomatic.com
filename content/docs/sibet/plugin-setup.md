# Plugin Setup

You need to set up the plugin to be able to use it.

## API Token

Your Sibet API Token is the license key you get when purchasing a subscription. You can get it from your [DinoMatic account](https://dinomatic.com/account).

### Add API Token

After activating Sibet plugin, you'll find a new menu item in your WordPress dashboard left hand navigation: **Sibet**. Visit that page by clicking the menu item or **Settings** link in your plugins listing.

You'll be prompted to add your API Token, enter it and click the **Save** button.

If you get an error that the license key is not correct and the registration fails:

- make sure there are no white spaces in the beginning or at the end of the key
- if you have firewall installed on your server, make sure requests to dinomatic.com are not being blocked
