# Bookmaker Settings

To fully integrate with your website, Sibet gives you the options to set your affiliate settings.

### Set Affiliate Links

For each bookmaker you have an input field to fill in your affiliate link so that they appear in the table at the top or inline with odds values.
You can also fill in a logo URL for each or them to use logos instead of their names. Names also can be customized on the same page.
