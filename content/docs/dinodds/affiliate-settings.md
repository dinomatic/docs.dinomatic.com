# Plugin Affiliate Settings

To fully integrate with your website, DinOdds gives you the options to set your affiliate settings.

### Set Affiliate Links

For each sportsbook you have an input field to fill in your affiliate link so that they appear in the table at the top or inline with odds values.

### Change Sportsbook Logos

You can also change the sportsbook logos instead of using the ones that come by default with the plugin.
You can do so by just changing the **Logo URL** field value with the image URL you want to display.

### Set Affiliate Link Attributes

At the bottom of **Sportsbook** section you can set affiliate link attributes such as `rel` or `target`.
By default they have the most used values but you can choose to set them to whatever you find appropriate for your website.
