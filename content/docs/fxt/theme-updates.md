# FXT Theme Updates

FXT theme includes an automatic update system that keeps your theme up to date with the latest features, security patches, and improvements.

## Automatic Updates

### How Updates Work

FXT theme automatically checks for updates through the DinoMatic update server:

1. **License Verification**: Updates are only available for registered themes
2. **Version Check**: The theme checks for new versions periodically
3. **Update Notification**: You'll be notified when updates are available
4. **One-Click Update**: Install updates directly from WordPress dashboard

### Update Requirements

To receive theme updates:

- **Valid License**: Your theme must be registered with a valid license key
- **Active License**: The license must be activated in FXT Options

## Manually Checking for Updates

4. Click **Update Now** to install the latest version

## Troubleshooting

### Update Issues

If you encounter problems with updates:
