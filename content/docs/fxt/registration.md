# Theme Registration

You need to register your theme to be able to receive new security and feature updates.

---

## License Key

You can get your license key from your [DinoMatic account](https://dinomatic.com/account)

### Add License Key

1. In WordPress dashboard visit **FXT Options** -> **Main Options**
2. Enter the license key you got from your account
3. Click `Activate License`
4. A message confirming the theme registration will appear

#### Handling possible issues

If you get an error that the license key is not correct and the registration fails:

- make sure there are no white spaces in the beginning or at the end of the key
- if you have firewall installed on your server, make sure requests to dinomatic.com are not being blocked
