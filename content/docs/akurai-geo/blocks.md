The 2nd tab, called Default, is where you select all reviews that you want to display to user's from countries that are not in the list of your targeted ones.

In the content editor a new message block edit section will appear. You can overwrite the default texts for messages for whether visitor's country is or isn't supported or keep the defaults.

Next you can select a style from the "Block Style" dropdown:
2 options with just message and country flag (flag being either on left or right side) and 2 options with the message, the flag as well as a bonus text and affiliate link (only for cases where country is supported).

There one more style called "No Styles" which will just print out the markup, and you can design your own message block by applying your CSS rules to it.
