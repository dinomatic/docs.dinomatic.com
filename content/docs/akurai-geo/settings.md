## Adjusting Settings

On this page you can register the plugin, as well as adjust all its settings.

If you get an error that the license key is not correct and the registration fails:

- make sure there are no white spaces in the beginning or at the end of the key
- if you have firewall installed on your server, make sure requests to dinomatic.com are not being blocked

### Target Countries

In order to make it easier, Akurai Geo plugin offers you to select your target countries in advance and all your blocks and other geo options will be then based on those countries.
