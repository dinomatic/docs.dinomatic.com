# Demo Games

Many casino affiliates want to add demo versions of casino games to their websites. In this page you'll find the recommended way of doing it for Spinoko theme.

### Spinoko + Slots Launch

[Slots Launch](https://dinomatic.com/refer/slotslaunch) provides an easy way for displaying demo games on your website. They have more than 17,000 games to choose from and a nice WordPress plugin to easily add those games.

The plugin integrates with Spinoko very nicely, and to make it even easier for you, I created a special child theme for Spinoko that you can install alongside the plugin.
The child theme provides you with standard WordPress blocks that you can use instead of shortcodes.
It also includes some styles to make the plugin sections look like part of the theme.

Here are a few easy steps that will allow you to display the demo games on your website:

- download the child theme from your [DinoMatic account](https://dinomatic.com/account)
- install the child theme and activate it
- sign up for an account at [slotslaunch.com](https://dinomatic.com/refer/slotslaunch) if you don't have one already
- download and install the Slots Launch WP plugin
- visit the plugin settings page and the setup wizard will take you through the process.

Now you can add any demo game you want to your website using nice and easy-to-use WordPress blocks.
You can also use blocks for "Game Archive" and "Provider Archive" shortcodes, and they will display a listing of games and game providers.
