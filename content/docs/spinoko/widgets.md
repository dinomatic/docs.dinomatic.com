### Blocks in Widgets

Since WordPress 5.9 you can use theme blocks in Widget areas of your website. The widgets below are now called "Legacy Widgets", and it's recommended to use theme blocks instead.
The legacy widgets work as expected though.

## Using Widgets

To add a widget to footer widgets area, in your WordPress dashboard visit **Appearance** &#8594; **Widgets**.
Or you can use the Customizer, visit **Appearance** &#8594; **Customize** and select **Widgets**.

Besides the default WordPress widgets, Spinoko Casino Widget is also available for you to use in footer.
