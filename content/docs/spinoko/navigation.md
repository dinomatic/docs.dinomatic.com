# Spinoko Navigation Menus

Spinoko has multiple navigation menus and you can even add one on your own. Learn more and how to do that below.

## Navigation Menus

By default Spinoko has 2 navigation menus:

1. Header navigation
2. Footer navigation

`💁 since version 2.4.0` you can [add an additional nav menu](#additional-navigation) to the site header if you want.

### Header Navigation

Header navigation is the primary navigation menu of the theme and it's a hamburger menu, by default closed on all screens regardless of the screen size.

### Footer Navigation

Footer navigation is an optional navigation menu and it's right above the copyright text in the theme footer area.

### Additional Navigation

`💁 since version 2.4.0` To display an additional (traditional) navigation menu on your website check the box for **Customizer** &#8594; **Miscellaneous Options** &#8594; **Display Traditional Menu** option.

After that visit **Customizer** &#8594; **Menus** and create a new menu (or use an existing one) to add it Additional menu location. Once you're happy with the results, publish the changes and it's done.

> Do not remove the main header (hamburger) navigation as it's displayed as the main menu on smaller screens.
