### Site Identity

As usual, set your site title and tagline, upload a custom logo and a favicon. If you have a really wide logo, you can hide the site title from header for better appearance.

### Colors

Spinoko has a lot of colors, there are **21 carefully selected colors** that are used all over the theme. You can adjust them to your liking and use your own color pallettes or the one that comes by default.

In case you want to restore them, here's a list of [default colors](/docs/spinoko/how-to#how-to-restore-default-theme-colors).
