# Translating The Theme

Spinoko is ready to be translated into any other language or even be used on a multilingual website.

### Single Language

By default everything in Spinoko is in English, and you can change that easily.
If you're website has a single language, you don't need any additional plugins to translate the theme.
All the text strings used in Spinoko can be edited, translated into any other language, in [Customizer &#8594; Strings](/docs/spinoko/customizations#strings).

### Multilingual

Spinoko comes with 100% multilingual support, it can be used to build multilingual websites. The main plugins such as WPML, Polylang can be used with Spinoko, and depending on the translation plugin you use, it may be a little different.

#### WPML

[WPML](https://wpml.org) is one of the most popular and powerful multilingual plugins for WordPress. It's been around for a long time and has great support in case you need it.
Using WPML with Spinoko theme is quite straightforward:

- I assume you already have Spinoko theme installed and activated.
- Install the WPML plugins - _WPML Multilingual CMS_ and _WPML String Translation_ - and activate them
- Follow the WPML's setup wizard which will guide you through the whole process of setting up the plugin including languages and more

You can translate your posts and pages, as well as casinos and games as usual. If you're not familiar with how WPML works, I'd recommend you start here - [Getting Started with WPML](https://wpml.org/documentation/getting-started-guide).

To translate other strings in Spinoko theme, you need to visit **WPML** &#8594; **String Translation** in your dashboard, and you'll find them all there. There are 2 groups of strings in Spinoko with the following text domains:

- "spinoko" - these are the strings that are visible on the front-end of the website
- "spinoko-admin" - these strings are only visible in the dashboard of your website.

To make it easier for you and help you move faster and save some time, I separated the strings. This way you can start with just "spinoko" strings, and come back to "spinoko-admin" when already done with the front-end.

If you need further assistance with WPML, please visit their [support forum](https://wpml.org/forums/forum/english-support).

#### Polylang

Polylang is another popular WP multilingual plugin, and it can be used along with Spinoko to create multilingual WordPress websites. After installing and activating the plugin, going through the setup steps, you can translate all the post types (posts, pages, casinos, games) as usual. If you're not familiar with Polylang, I'd suggest you check out their "[Getting Started](https://polylang.pro/doc-category/getting-started/)" series of articles.

If you need further assistance with Polylang, please visit their [support page](https://polylang.pro/doc/) where you can also submit a support request.

### RTL and TTB

Spinoko can be translated into any language, it has built-in support for right-to-left (RTL), as well as top-to-bottom (TTB) languages.
