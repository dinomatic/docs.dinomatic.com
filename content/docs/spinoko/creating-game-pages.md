# Creating Game Pages

In your WordPress dashboard you will find a new menu item called **Games** right below the **Casinos** menu link. Click `Add New` to add a new game.

### Game Fields

Besides adding the game title and content as usual, you'll find Game Fields section below the page content. Here you can define properties for each game.

Game fields are in separate sections and have descriptions to make it easy for you to fill them in. These properties are used all over the website, please make sure to complete them.
